### AboutProject: 
- I created a Resume Screening app employing NLP, capable of parsing resumes and determining the most suitable roles for candidates. By leveraging advanced NLP techniques, the app automates the tedious task of manual resume screening, providing accurate role recommendations based on candidate qualifications and job requirements.

- Utilized TF-IDF for feature extraction, enhancing the model's understanding of resume content. Integrated a one-vs-rest classifier for efficient production handling of multiple role categories. Streamlined deployment using Streamlit, providing a user-friendly interface for seamless resume screening and role recommendations.
